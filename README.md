# YoloV5_Benchmarking_AIDI

### INTRODUCTION: 

In the fast-paced world of computer vision, the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm is recognized as an innovative method for detecting objects. YOLOv5, the newest version, has attracted considerable interest for its impressive capability to handle intricate and cluttered visual information with great efficiency and precision. Its compatibility with Python, a leading programming language in data science, further enhances its accessibility and integration into various machine learning workflows. 

Since its launch, YOLO has undergone several revisions, with the most recent being YOLOv6/v7 and YOLOv5, which were released in 2020 and 2022,respectively.Significant improvements have been made in these versions; YOLOv5, in particular, offers less size, faster performance, and higher accuracyâ€”all inside the well-established PyTorch ML environment. Although YOLO is an excellent example of how effective single-stage models can be, it is used in conjunction with two-stage object identification algorithms such as R-CNN, which are superior at handling complicated picture targets but come at a higher computational cost.Due to its adaptability and efficiency, YOLOv5 is a popular choice for data science endeavors, especially for classifying datasets available on platforms such as Kaggle.

The YOLO classifier family performs exceptionally well in offline studies and real-time applications for object recognition and picture classification. Although YOLO is clearly well-known, it competes with other prominent algorithms like R-CNN and Fast R-CNN, each of which makes a distinct contribution to the object identification space.

This paper endeavors to conduct a comprehensive comparison of different YOLOv5 model versions using a common image datasets. 

### AIM :

The YOLOv5 models were trained on datasets designed to train deep neural networks to detect the human face and classify whether the person in the image is wearing a mask and wearing it properly. Out objective here is to detect a human face in a picture and classify whether the person is wearing a mask. So, an experiment was developed to identify a person's face in an image and determine whether or not they are wearing a mask.
